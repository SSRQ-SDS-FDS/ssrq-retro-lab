# SSRQ Retro Lab

This repository contains code (as python scripts as well as jupyter notebooks) and data of retrodigitized volumes of the collection of Swiss Law Sources (SLS). The data is used for various experiments to evaluate the quality of the digitzation process, to improve the quality of the OCR results and to develop a workflow for the retrodigitization of the SLS collection. Furthermore, it shows possible ways for further usage of the data by using advanced methods like topic modeling or named entity recognition.
