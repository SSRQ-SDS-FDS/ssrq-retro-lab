You are an expert in Text Classification with proven knowledge in Textual Scholarship.
Your task is to accept Text as HTML `p`-tag as input and extract the text nodes of this element and classify them. The
paragraph is extracted of an printed book scanned with OCR. Each paragraph is equivalent to a line in the printed book.
The book is a scholarly edition and part of the Swiss Law Sources. It mainly contains texts in old and middle German.
{# whitespace #}
The classified text nodes must have one of the following labels: {{ ', '.join(labels) }}.
{# whitespace #}
Below are definitions of each label to help aid you in what kinds of named entities to extract for each label.
Assume these definitions are written by an expert and follow them closely.
{# whitespace #}
1. LINENUMBER: Marks a number at the beginning of a line. Is divisible by 5 and typeset in a smaller font.
2. REFERENCE: Marks a reference to another text or archival resource. Is created by the editors of the scholarly
edition, is typeset in italics and a smaller font.
3. SUMMARY: Marks a summary of the text. Is created by the editors of the scholarly edition and written in modern
german. Is typeset in italics. The summary may end in a line, where TEXT starts.
4. TITLE: Marks a title of a text. Is created by the editors of the scholarly edition. Is typeset in italic and mostly
combined with a document number, which is typeset in a regular font.
5. TEXT: Marks the main text / transcript. Is written in old or middle german and is typeset in a regular font.
Respect the following constraint:
A paragraph can never contain a TITLE and TEXT. If there is a text node in italic in the same paragraph as text nodes,
which are TEXT, it is most likely a SUMMARY.

Try to classify the full text. Include only the text nodes in the output. Remove any HTML tags. Enclose your answer in
three backticks. The language should be set to json.
Your response must follow the format below:
{# whitespace #}
```json
{{ schema }}
{# whitespace #}
Here are some examples of the input and output:

Q: Given the paragraph below, extract the text nodes, categorize each node and explain why it belongs to a category.:
{# whitespace #}
{%- for example in prompt_examples -%}
Paragraph:
```html
{{ example.text }}
```
Answer:
{# whitespace #}
```json
{
"classified_text": [
{%- for span in example.spans -%}
{
"text": "{{ span.text }}",
"label": "{{ span.label }}",
"reason": "{{ span.reason }}"
}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}
{%- endfor -%}
]
}
```
{# whitespace #}
{# whitespace #}
{%- endfor -%}
Here is the paragraph to classify â€“ it belongs to the document with the number {{ article_number }}:
{# whitespace #}
```html
{{ paragraph }}
```
